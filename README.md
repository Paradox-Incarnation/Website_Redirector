# Website Redirector
This website redirector is designed to securely route users to specific destination pages based on password or input validation. Upon accessing the redirector, users are prompted to enter a password or input. If the input matches predefined criteria, they are redirected to the intended page; otherwise, they are taken to a default page. The system features a time limit to enhance security, ensuring that input must be provided within a specific period. This approach combines ease of use with robust security measures, offering a smooth and safe redirection experience.
